<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth—the source of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is opposed to the truth—even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to distinguish between true and false. And he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly reproaching nature—complaining that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Some things nature is indifferent to; if it privileged one over the other it would hardly have created both. And if we want to follow nature, to be of one mind with it, we need to share its indifference. To privilege pleasure over pain—life over death, fame over anonymity—is clearly blasphemous. Nature certainly doesn’t.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And when I say that nature is indifferent to them, I mean that they happen indifferently, at different times, to the things that exist and the things that come into being after them, through some ancient decree of Providence—the decree by which from some initial starting point it embarked on the creation that we know, by laying down the principles of what was to come and determining the generative forces: existence and change, and their successive stages.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. Real good luck would be to abandon life without ever encountering dishonesty, or hypocrisy, or self-indulgence, or pride. But the “next best voyage” is to die when you’ve had enough. Or are you determined to lie down with evil? Hasn’t experience even taught you <em class="italic">that—</em>to avoid it like the plague? Because it <em class="italic">is</em> a plague—a mental cancer—worse than anything caused by tainted air or an unhealthy climate. Diseases like that can only threaten your life; this one attacks your humanity.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Don’t look down on death, but welcome it. It too is one of the things required by nature. Like youth and old age. Like growth and maturity. Like a new set of teeth, a beard, the first gray hair. Like sex and pregnancy and childbirth. Like all the other physical changes at each stage of life, our dissolution is no different.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So this is how a thoughtful person should await death: not with indifference, not with impatience, not with disdain, but simply viewing it as one of the things that happen to us. Now you anticipate the child’s emergence from its mother’s womb; that’s how you should await the hour when your soul will emerge from its compartment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or perhaps you need some tidy aphorism to tuck away in the back of your mind. Well, consider two things that should reconcile you to death: the nature of the things you’ll leave behind you, and the kind of people you’ll no longer be mixed up with. There’s no need to feel resentment toward them—in fact, you should look out for their well-being, and be gentle with them—but keep in mind that everything you believe is meaningless to those you leave behind. Because that’s all that could restrain us (if anything could)—the only thing that could make us want to stay here: the chance to live with those who share our vision. But now? Look how tiring it is—this cacophony we live in. Enough to make you say to death, “Come quickly. Before I start to forget myself, like them.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. To do harm is to do yourself harm. To do an injustice is to do yourself an injustice—it degrades you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. And you can also commit injustice by doing nothing.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. Objective judgment, now, at this very moment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Unselfish action, now, at this very moment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Willing acceptance—now, at this very moment—of all external events.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That’s all you need.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. Blot out your imagination. Turn your desire to stone. Quench your appetites. Keep your mind centered on itself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. Animals without the <em class="italic">logos</em> are assigned the same soul, and those who have the <em class="italic">logos</em> share one too—a rational one. Just as all earthly creatures share one earth. Just as we all see by the same light, and breathe the same air—all of us who see and breathe.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. All things are drawn toward what is like them, if such a thing exists. All earthly things feel the earth’s tug. All wet things flow together. And airy things as well, so they have to be forcibly prevented from mixing. Fire is naturally drawn upward by that higher fire, but ready to ignite at the slightest touch of other, earthly flame. So that anything drier than usual makes good fuel, because less of what hinders combustion is mixed in with it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And things that share an intelligent nature are just as prone to seek out what is like them. If not more so. Because their superiority in other ways is matched by their greater readiness to mix and mingle with their counterparts.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Even in irrational beings we see swarms and herds, and nesting, and love not unlike ours. Because they do have souls, and the bonding instinct is found in a developed form—not something we see in plants, or stones, or trees. And it’s still more developed in rational beings, with their states, friendships, families, groups, their treaties and truces. And in those yet more developed there is a kind of unity even between separate things, the kind that we see in the stars. An advanced level of development can produce a sympathy even in things that are quite distinct.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But look how things are now. The rational things are the only ones that have lost that sense of attraction—of convergence. Only there do we not see that intermingling. But however much they try to avoid it, there’s no escaping. Nature is stronger. As you can see if you look closely.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Concrete objects can pull free of the earth more easily than humans can escape humanity.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. Humanity, divinity, and the world: all of them bearing fruit. Each fruitful in its season. Normally we limit the word to vines and other plants. Unnecessarily. The fruit of the <em class="italic">logos</em> nourishes both us and it. And other things spring from it too—of the same species as the <em class="italic">logos</em> itself.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. When we cease from activity, or follow a thought to its conclusion, it’s a kind of death. And it doesn’t harm us. Think about your life: childhood, boyhood, youth, old age. Every transformation a kind of dying. Was that so terrible?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Think about life with your grandfather, your mother, your adopted father. Realize how many other deaths and transformations and endings there have been and ask yourself: Was that so terrible?</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Do what nature demands. Get a move on—if you have it in you—and don’t worry whether anyone will give you credit for it. And don’t go expecting Plato’s Republic; be satisfied with even the smallest progress, and treat the outcome of it all as unimportant.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Who can change their minds? And without that change, what is there but groaning, slavery, a pretense of obedience? Go on and cite Alexander, Philip, Demetrius of Phalerum. Whether they knew nature’s will and made themselves its student is for them to say. And if they preferred to play the king? Well, no one forced me to be their understudy.</span></p></div>

To see them from above: the thousands of animal herds, the rituals, the voyages on calm or stormy seas, the different ways we come into the world, share it with one another, and leave it. Consider the lives led once by others, long ago, the lives to be led by others after you, the lives led even now, in foreign lands. How many people don’t even know your name. How many will soon have forgotten it. How many offer you praise now—and tomorrow, perhaps, contempt.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And when others stray off course, you can always try to set them straight, because every wrongdoer is doing something wrong—doing something <em class="italic">the wrong way.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And how does it injure you anyway? You’ll find that none of the people you’re upset about has done anything that could do damage to your mind. But that’s all that “harm” or “injury” could mean. Yes, boorish people do boorish things. What’s strange or unheard-of about that? Isn’t it yourself you should reproach—for not anticipating that they’d act this way? The <em class="italic">logos</em> gave you the means to see it—that a given person would act a given way—but you paid no attention. And now you’re astonished that he’s gone and done it. So when you call someone “untrustworthy” or “ungrateful,” turn the reproach on yourself. It was <em class="italic">you</em> who did wrong. By assuming that someone with those traits deserved your trust. Or by doing them a favor and expecting something in return, instead of looking to the action itself for your reward. What else did you expect from helping someone out? Isn’t it enough that you’ve done what your nature demands? You want a salary for it too? As if your eyes expected a reward for seeing, or your feet for walking. That’s what they were made for. By doing what they were designed to do, they’re performing their function. Whereas humans were made to help others. And when we do help others—or help them to do something—we’re doing what we were designed for. We perform our function.</span></p></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_32"></div>
