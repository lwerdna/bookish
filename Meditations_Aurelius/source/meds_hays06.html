<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Nature is pliable, obedient. And the <em class="italic">logos</em> that governs it has no reason to do evil. It knows no evil, does none, and causes harm to nothing. It dictates all beginnings and all endings.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. Just that you do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_6"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Dying . . . or busy with other assignments.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Because dying, too, is one of our assignments in life. There as well: “to do what needs doing.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Look inward. Don’t let the true nature or value of anything elude you.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Only there, delight and stillness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. The mind is that which is roused and directed by itself. It makes of itself what it chooses. It makes what it chooses of its own experience.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. Everything is brought about by nature, not by anything beyond it, or within it, or apart from it.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. When jarred, unavoidably, by circumstances, revert at once to yourself, and don’t lose the rhythm more than you can help. You’ll have a better grasp of the harmony if you keep on going back to it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. If you had a stepmother and a real mother, you would pay your respects to your stepmother, yes . . . but it’s your real mother you’d go home to.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The court . . . and philosophy: Keep returning to it, to rest in its embrace. It’s all that makes the court—and you—endurable.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. Like seeing roasted meat and other dishes in front of you and suddenly realizing: This is a dead fish. A dead bird. A dead pig. Or that this noble vintage is grape juice, and the purple robes are sheep wool dyed with shellfish blood. Or making love—something rubbing against your penis, a brief seizure and a little cloudy liquid.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Perceptions like that—latching onto things and piercing through them, so we see what they really are. That’s what we need to do all the time—all through our lives when things lay claim to our trust—to lay them bare and see how pointless they are, to strip away the legend that encrusts them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Pride is a master of deception: when you think you’re occupied in the weightiest business, that’s when he has you in his spell.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> (Compare Crates on Xenocrates.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. Things ordinary people are impressed by fall into the categories of things that are held together by simple physics (like stones or wood), or by natural growth (figs, vines, olives . . .). Those admired by more advanced minds are held together by a living soul (flocks of sheep, herds of cows). Still more sophisticated people admire what is guided by a rational mind—not the universal mind, but one admired for its technical knowledge, or for some other skill—or just because it happens to own a lot of slaves.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But those who revere that other mind—the one we all share, as humans and as citizens—aren’t interested in other things. Their focus is on the state of their own minds—to avoid all selfishness and illogic, and to work with others to achieve that goal.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. Some things are rushing into existence, others out of it. Some of what now exists is already gone. Change and flux constantly remake the world, just as the incessant progression of time remakes eternity.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> We find ourselves in a river. Which of the things around us should we value when none of them can offer a firm foothold?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Like an attachment to a sparrow: we glimpse it and it’s gone.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And life itself: like the decoction of blood, the drawing in of air. We expel the power of breathing we drew in at birth (just yesterday or the day before), breathing it out like the air we exhale at each moment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. What is it in ourselves that we should prize?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not just transpiration (even plants do that).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or respiration (even beasts and wild animals breathe).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or being struck by passing thoughts.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or jerked like a puppet by your own impulses.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or moving in herds.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or eating, and relieving yourself afterwards.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then what is to be prized?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> An audience clapping? No. No more than the clacking of their tongues. Which is all that public praise amounts to—a clacking of tongues.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So we throw out other people’s recognition. What’s left for us to prize?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> I think it’s this: to do (and not do) what we were designed for. That’s the goal of all trades, all arts, and what each of them aims at: that the thing they create should do what it was designed to do. The nurseryman who cares for the vines, the horse trainer, the dog breeder—this is what they aim at. And teaching and education—what else are they trying to accomplish?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So that’s what we should prize. Hold on to that, and you won’t be tempted to aim at anything else.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if you can’t stop prizing a lot of other things? Then you’ll never be free—free, independent, imperturbable. Because you’ll always be envious and jealous, afraid that people might come and take it all away from you. Plotting against those who have them—those things you prize. People who need those things are bound to be a mess—and bound to take out their frustrations on the gods. Whereas to respect your own mind—to prize it—will leave you satisfied with your own self, well integrated into your community and in tune with the gods as well—embracing what they allot you, and what they ordain.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. The elements move upward, downward, in all directions. The motion of virtue is different—deeper. It moves at a steady pace on a road hard to discern, and always forward.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. The way people behave. They refuse to admire their contemporaries, the people whose lives they share. No, but to be admired by Posterity—people they’ve never met and never will—that’s what they set their hearts on. You might as well be upset at not being a hero to your great-grandfather.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. Not to assume it’s impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it’s humanly possible, you can do it too.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. In the ring, our opponents can gouge us with their nails or butt us with their heads and leave a bruise, but we don’t denounce them for it or get upset with them or regard them from then on as violent types. We just keep an eye on them after that. Not out of hatred or suspicion. Just keeping a friendly distance.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> We need to do that in other areas. We need to excuse what our sparring partners do, and just keep our distance—without suspicion or hatred.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. If anyone can refute me—show me I’m making a mistake or looking at things from the wrong perspective—I’ll gladly change. It’s the truth I’m after, and the truth never harmed anyone. What harms us is to persist in self-deceit and ignorance.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22. I do what is mine to do; the rest doesn’t disturb me. The rest is inanimate, or has no <em class="italic">logos,</em> or it wanders at random and has lost the road.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. When you deal with irrational animals, with things and circumstances, be generous and straightforward. You are rational; they are not. When you deal with fellow human beings, behave as one. They share in the <em class="italic">logos</em>. And invoke the gods regardless.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Don’t worry about how long you’ll go on doing this.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A single afternoon would be enough.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. Alexander the Great and his mule driver both died and the same thing happened to both. They were absorbed alike into the life force of the world, or dissolved alike into atoms.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 25. Think how much is going on inside you every second—in your soul, in your body. Why should it astonish you that so much more—everything that happens in that all-embracing unity, the world—is happening at the same time?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 26. If someone asked you how to write your name, would you clench your teeth and spit out the letters one by one? If he lost his temper, would you lose yours as well? Or would you just spell out the individual letters?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Remember—your responsibilities can be broken down into individual parts as well. Concentrate on those, and finish the job methodically—without getting stirred up or meeting anger with anger.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 27. How cruel—to forbid people to want what they think is good for them. And yet that’s just what you won’t let them do when you get angry at their misbehavior. They’re drawn toward what they think is good for them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —But it’s <em class="italic">not</em> good for them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then show them that. Prove it to them. Instead of losing your temper.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 28. Death. The end of sense-perception, of being controlled by our emotions, of mental activity, of enslavement to our bodies.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 29. Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 30. To escape imperialization—that indelible stain. It happens. Make sure you remain straightforward, upright, reverent, serious, unadorned, an ally of justice, pious, kind, affectionate, and doing your duty with a will. Fight to be the person philosophy tried to make you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Revere the gods; watch over human beings. Our lives are short. The only rewards of our existence here are an unstained character and unselfish acts.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Take Antoninus as your model, always. His energy in doing what was rational . . . his steadiness in any situation . . . his sense of reverence . . . his calm expression . . . his gentleness . . . his modesty . . . his eagerness to grasp things. And how he never let things go before he was sure he had examined them thoroughly, understood them perfectly . . . the way he put up with unfair criticism, without returning it . . . how he couldn’t be hurried . . . how he wouldn’t listen to informers . . . how reliable he was as a judge of character, and of actions . . . not prone to backbiting, or cowardice, or jealousy, or empty rhetoric . . . content with the basics—in living quarters, bedding, clothes, food, servants . . . how hard he worked, how much he put up with . . . his ability to work straight through till dusk—because of his simple diet (he didn’t even need to relieve himself, except at set times) . . . his constancy and reliability as a friend . . . his tolerance of people who openly questioned his views and his delight at seeing his ideas improved on . . . his piety—without a trace of superstition . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So that when your time comes, your conscience will be as clear as his.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 31. Awaken; return to yourself. Now, no longer asleep, knowing they were only dreams, clear-headed again, treat everything around you as a dream.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 32. I am composed of a body and a soul.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Things that happen to the body are meaningless. It cannot discriminate among them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Nothing has meaning to my mind except its own actions. Which are within its own control. And it’s only the immediate ones that matter. Its past and future actions too are meaningless.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 33. It’s normal to feel pain in your hands and feet, if you’re using your feet as feet and your hands as hands. And for a human being to feel stress is normal—if he’s living a normal human life.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if it’s normal, how can it be bad?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 34. Thieves, perverts, parricides, dictators: the kind of pleasures they enjoy.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 35. Have you noticed how professionals will meet the man on the street halfway but without compromising the <em class="italic">logos</em> of their trade? Should we as humans feel less responsibility to our <em class="italic">logos</em> than builders or pharmacists do? A <em class="italic">logos</em> we share with the divine?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 36. Asia and Europe: distant recesses of the universe.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The ocean: a drop of water.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Mount Athos: a molehill.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The present: a split second in eternity.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Minuscule, transitory, insignificant.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 36a. Everything derives from it—that universal mind—either as effect or consequence. The lion’s jaws, the poisonous substances, and every harmful thing—from thorns to mud . . . are by-products of the good and beautiful. So don’t look at them as alien to what you revere, but focus on the source that all things spring from.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 37. If you’ve seen the present then you’ve seen everything—as it’s been since the beginning, as it will be forever. The same substance, the same form. All of it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 38. Keep reminding yourself of the way things are connected, of their relatedness. All things are implicated in one another and in sympathy with each other. This event is the consequence of some other one. Things push and pull on each other, and breathe together, and are one.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 39. The things ordained for you—teach yourself to be at one with those. And the people who share them with you—treat them with love.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> With <em class="italic">real</em> love.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 40. Implements, tools, equipment. If they do what they were designed for, then they work. Even if the person who designed them is miles away.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But with naturally occurring things, the force that designed them is present within them and remains there. Which is why we owe it special reverence, with the recognition that if you live and act as it dictates, then everything in you is intelligently ordered. Just as everything in the world is.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 41. You take things you don’t control and define them as “good” or “bad.” And so of course when the “bad” things happen, or the “good” ones don’t, you blame the gods and feel hatred for the people responsible—or those you decide to make responsible. Much of our bad behavior stems from trying to apply those criteria. If we limited “good” and “bad” to our own actions, we’d have no call to challenge God, or to treat other people as enemies.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 42. All of us are working on the same project. Some consciously, with understanding; some without knowing it. (I think this is what Heraclitus meant when he said that “those who sleep are also hard at work”—that they too collaborate in what happens.) Some of us work in one way, and some in others. And those who complain and try to obstruct and thwart things—they help as much as anyone. The world needs them as well.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So make up your mind who you’ll choose to work with. The force that directs all things will make good use of you regardless—will put you on its payroll and set you to work. But make sure it’s not the job Chrysippus speaks of: the bad line in the play, put there for laughs.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 43. Does the sun try to do the rain’s work? Or Asclepius Demeter’s? And what about each of the stars—different, yet working in common?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 44. If the gods have made decisions about me and the things that happen to me, then they were good decisions. (It’s hard to picture a god who makes bad ones.) And why would they expend their energies on causing me harm? What good would it do them—or the world, which is their primary concern?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if they haven’t made decisions about me as an individual, they certainly have about the general welfare. And anything that follows from that is something I have to welcome and embrace.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if they make no decisions, about anything—and it’s blasphemous even to think so (because if so, then let’s stop sacrificing, praying, swearing oaths, and doing all the other things we do, believing the whole time that the gods are right here with us)—if they decide nothing about our lives . . . well, <em class="italic">I </em>can still make decisions. Can still consider what it’s to my benefit to do. And what benefits anyone is to do what his own nature requires. And mine is rational. Rational and civic.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> My city and state are Rome—as Antoninus. But as a human being? The world. So for me, “good” can only mean what’s good for both communities.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 45. Whatever happens to you is for the good of the world. That would be enough right there. But if you look closely you’ll generally notice something else as well: whatever happens to a single person is for the good of others. (Good in the ordinary sense—as the world defines it.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 46. Just as the arena and the other spectacles weary you—you’ve seen them all before—and the repetition grates on your nerves, so too with life. The same things, the same causes, on all sides.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 47. Keep this constantly in mind: that all sorts of people have died—all professions, all nationalities.
