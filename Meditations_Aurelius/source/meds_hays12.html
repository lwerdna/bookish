<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Everything you’re trying to reach—by taking the long way round—you could have right now, this moment. If you’d only stop thwarting your own attempts. If you’d only let go of the past, entrust the future to Providence, and guide the present toward reverence and justice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Reverence: so you’ll accept what you’re allotted. Nature intended it for you, and you for it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Justice: so that you’ll speak the truth, frankly and without evasions, and act as you should—and as other people deserve.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Don’t let anything deter you: other people’s misbehavior, your own misperceptions, What People Will Say, or the feelings of the body that covers you (let the affected part take care of those). And if, when it’s time to depart, you shunt everything aside except your mind and the divinity within . . . if it isn’t ceasing to live that you’re afraid of but never beginning to live properly . . . then you’ll be worthy of the world that made you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No longer an alien in your own land.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No longer shocked by everyday events—as if they were unheard-of aberrations.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No longer at the mercy of this, or that.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. God sees all our souls freed from their fleshly containers, stripped clean of their bark, cleansed of their grime. He grasps with his intelligence alone what was poured and channeled from himself into them. If you learn to do the same, you can avoid a great deal of distress. When you see through the flesh that covers you, will you be unsettled by clothing, mansions, celebrity—the painted sets, the costume cupboard?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Your three components: body, breath, mind. Two are yours in trust; to the third alone you have clear title.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If you can cut yourself—your mind—free of what other people do and say, of what you’ve said or done, of the things that you’re afraid will happen, the impositions of the body that contains you and the breath within, and what the whirling chaos sweeps in from outside, so that the mind is freed from fate, brought to clarity, and lives life on its own recognizance—doing what’s right, accepting what happens, and speaking the truth—</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If you can cut free of impressions that cling to the mind, free of the future and the past—can make yourself, as Empedocles says, “a sphere rejoicing in its perfect stillness,” and concentrate on living what can be lived (which means the present) . . . then you can spend the time you have left in tranquillity. And in kindness. And at peace with the spirit within you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own. If a god appeared to us—or a wise human being, even—and prohibited us from concealing our thoughts or imagining anything without immediately shouting it out, we wouldn’t make it through a single day. That’s how much we value other people’s opinions—instead of our own.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. How is it that the gods arranged everything with such skill, such care for our well-being, and somehow overlooked one thing: that certain people—in fact, the best of them, the gods’ own partners, the ones whose piety and good works brought them closest to the divine—that these people, when they die, should cease to exist forever? Utterly vanished.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Well, assuming that’s really true, you can be sure they would have arranged things differently, if that had been appropriate. If it were the right thing to do, they could have done it, and if it were natural, nature would have demanded it. So from the fact that they didn’t—if that’s the case—we can conclude that it was inappropriate.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Surely you can see yourself that to ask the question is to challenge the gods’ fairness. And why would you be bringing in fairness unless the gods are, in fact, fair—and absolutely so?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if they are, how could they have carelessly overlooked something so unfair—so illogical—in setting up the world?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. Practice even what seems impossible.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The left hand is useless at almost everything, for lack of practice. But it guides the reins better than the right. From practice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. The condition of soul and body when death comes for us.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Shortness of life.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Vastness of time before and after.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. To see the causes of things stripped bare. The aim of actions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Pain. Pleasure. Death. Fame.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Who is responsible for our own restlessness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That no one obstructs us.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That it’s all in how you perceive it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. The student as boxer, not fencer.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The fencer’s weapon is picked up and put down again.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The boxer’s is part of him. All he has to do is clench his fist.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. To see things as they are. Substance, cause and purpose.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. The freedom to do only what God wants, and accept whatever God sends us.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11a. What it’s made of.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. The gods are not to blame. They do nothing wrong, on purpose or by accident. Nor men either; they don’t do it on purpose. No one is to blame.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. The foolishness of people who are surprised by anything that happens. Like travelers amazed at foreign customs.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. Fatal necessity, and inescapable order. Or benevolent Providence. Or confusion—random and undirected.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If it’s an inescapable necessity, why resist it?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If it’s Providence, and admits of being worshipped, then try to be worthy of God’s aid.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If it’s confusion and anarchy, then be grateful that on this raging sea you have a mind to guide you. And if the storm should carry you away, let it carry off flesh, breath and all the rest, but not the mind. Which can’t be swept away.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. The lamp shines until it is put out, without losing its gleam, and yet in you it all gutters out so early—truth, justice, self-control?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. When someone seems to have injured you:</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • that he’s already been tried and convicted—by himself. (Like scratching your own eyes out.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • that to expect a bad person not to harm others is like expecting fig trees not to secrete juice, babies not to cry, horses not to neigh—the inevitable not to happen.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What else could they do—with that sort of character?</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. If it’s not right, don’t do it. If it’s not true, don’t say it. Let your intention be &lt; . . . &gt;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. At all times, look at the thing itself—the thing behind the appearance—and unpack it by analysis:</span></p></div>

</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What’s in my thoughts at this moment? Fear? Jealousy? Desire? Feelings like that?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. To undertake nothing:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> i. at random or without a purpose;</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. That before long you’ll be no one, and nowhere. Like all the things you see now. All the people now living.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Everything’s destiny is to change, to be transformed, to perish. So that new things can be born.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22. It’s all in how you perceive it. You’re in control. You can dispense with misperception at will, like rounding the point. Serenity, total calm, safe anchorage.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. A given action that stops when it’s supposed to is none the worse for stopping. Nor the person engaged in it either. So too with the succession of actions we call “life.” If it ends when it’s supposed to, it’s none the worse for that. And the person who comes to the end of the line has no cause for complaint. The time and stopping point are set by nature—our own nature, in some cases (death from old age); or nature as a whole, whose parts, shifting and changing, constantly renew the world, and keep it on schedule.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Nothing that benefits all things can be ugly or out of place. The end of life is not an evil—it doesn’t disgrace us. (Why should we be ashamed of an involuntary act that injures no one?). It’s a good thing—scheduled by the world, promoting it, promoted by it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> This is how we become godlike—following God’s path, and reason’s goals.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. Three things, essential at all times:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> i(a). your own actions: that they’re not arbitrary or different from what abstract justice would do.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> i(b). external events: that they happen randomly or by design. You can’t complain about chance. You can’t argue with Providence.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> ii. what all things are like, from the planting of the seed to the quickening of life, and from its quickening to its relinquishment. Where the parts came from and where they return to.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> iii. that if you were suddenly lifted up and could see life and its variety from a vast height, and at the same time all the things around you, in the sky and beyond it, you’d see how pointless it is. And no matter how often you saw it, it would be the same: the same life forms, the same life span.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 25. Throw out your misperceptions and you’ll be fine. (And who’s stopping you from throwing them out?)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 26. To be angry at something means you’ve forgotten:</span></p></div>

<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That everything that happens is natural.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What links one human being to all humans: not blood, or birth, but mind.</span></p></div>

<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That an individual’s mind is God and of God.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That nothing belongs to anyone. Children, body, life itself—all of them come from that same source.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That it’s all how you choose to see things.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That the present is all we have to live in. Or to lose.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 27. Constantly run down the list of those who felt intense anger at something: the most famous, the most unfortunate, the most hated, the most whatever. And ask: Where is all that now? Smoke, dust, legend . . . or not even a legend. Think of all the examples: Fabius Catullinus in the country, Lusius Lupus in the orchard, Stertinius at Baiae, Tiberius on Capri, Velius Rufus . . . obsession and arrogance.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And how trivial the things we want so passionately are. And how much more philosophical it would be to take what we’re given and show uprightness, self-control, obedience to God, without making a production of it.

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 28. People ask, “Have you ever seen the gods you worship? How can you be sure they exist?”</span></p></div>
