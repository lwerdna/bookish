<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Another encouragement to humility: you can’t claim to have lived your life as a philosopher—not even your whole adulthood. You can see for yourself how far you are from philosophy. And so can many others. You’re tainted. It’s not so easy now—to have a reputation as a philosopher. And your position is an obstacle as well.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So you know how things stand. Now forget what they think of you. Be satisfied if you can live the rest of your life, however short, as your nature demands. Focus on that, and don’t let anything distract you. You’ve wandered all over and finally realized that you never found what you were after: how to live. Not in syllogisms, not in money, or fame, or self-indulgence. Nowhere.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —Then where is it to be found?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> In doing what human nature requires.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —How?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Through first principles. Which should govern your intentions and your actions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —What principles?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Those to do with good and evil. That nothing is good except what leads to fairness, and self-control, and courage, and free will. And nothing bad except what does the opposite.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. For every action, ask: How does it affect me? Could I change my mind about it?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But soon I’ll be dead, and the slate’s empty. So this is the only question: Is it the action of a responsible being, part of society, and subject to the same decrees as God?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Alexander and Caesar and Pompey. Compared with Diogenes, Heraclitus, Socrates? The philosophers knew the what, the why, the how. Their minds were their own.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The others? Nothing but anxiety and enslavement.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. You can hold your breath until you turn blue, but they’ll still go on doing it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. The first step: Don’t be anxious. Nature controls it all. And before long you’ll be no one, nowhere—like Hadrian, like Augustus.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The second step: Concentrate on what you have to do. Fix your eyes on it. Remind yourself that your task is to be a good human being; remind yourself what nature demands of people. Then do it, without hesitation, and speak the truth as you see it. But with kindness. With humility. Without hypocrisy.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. Nature’s job: to shift things elsewhere, to transform them, to pick them up and move them here and there. Constant alteration. But not to worry: there’s nothing new here. Everything is familiar. Even the proportions are unchanged.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. Nature of any kind thrives on forward progress. And progress for a rational mind means not accepting falsehood or uncertainty in its perceptions, making unselfish actions its only aim, seeking and shunning only the things it has control over, embracing what nature demands of it—the nature in which it participates, as the leaf’s nature does in the tree’s. Except that the nature shared by the leaf is without consciousness or reason, and subject to impediments. Whereas that shared by human beings is without impediments, and rational, and just, since it allots to each and every thing an equal and proportionate share of time, being, purpose, action, chance. Examine it closely. Not whether they’re identical point by point, but in the aggregate: this weighed against that.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. No time for reading. For controlling your arrogance, yes. For overcoming pain and pleasure, yes. For outgrowing ambition, yes. For not feeling anger at stupid and unpleasant people—even for caring about them—for that, yes.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. Don’t be overheard complaining about life at court. Not even to yourself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. Remorse is annoyance at yourself for having passed up something that’s to your benefit. But if it’s to your benefit it must be good—something a truly good person would be concerned about.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But no truly good person would feel remorse at passing up pleasure.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So it cannot be to your benefit, or good.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. What is this, fundamentally? What is its nature and substance, its reason for being? What is it doing in the world? How long is it here for?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. When you have trouble getting out of bed in the morning, remember that your defining characteristic—what defines a human being—is to work with others. Even animals know how to sleep. And it’s the characteristic activity that’s the more natural one—more innate and more satisfying.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. Apply them constantly, to everything that happens: Physics. Ethics. Logic.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. When you have to deal with someone, ask yourself: What does he mean by good and bad? If he thinks <em class="italic">x</em> or <em class="italic">y</em> about pleasure and pain (and what produces them), about fame and disgrace, about death and life, then it shouldn’t shock or surprise you when he <em class="italic">does x</em> or <em class="italic">y.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> In fact, I’ll remind myself that he has no real choice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. Remember: you shouldn’t be surprised that a fig tree produces figs, nor the world what it produces. A good doctor isn’t surprised when his patients have fevers, or a helmsman when the wind blows against him.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. Remember that to change your mind and to accept correction are free acts too. The action is yours, based on your own will, your own decision—and your own mind.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. If it’s in your control, why do you do it? If it’s in someone else’s, then who are you blaming? Atoms? The gods? Stupid either way.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Blame no one. Set people straight, if you can. If not, just repair the damage. And suppose you can’t do that either. Then where does blaming people get you?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No pointless actions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. What dies doesn’t vanish. It stays here in the world, transformed, dissolved, as parts of the world, and of you. Which are transformed in turn—without grumbling.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. Everything is here for a purpose, from horses to vine shoots. What’s surprising about that? Even the sun will tell you, “I have a purpose,” and the other gods as well. And why were <em class="italic">you </em>born? For pleasure? See if that answer will stand up to questioning.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. Nature is like someone throwing a ball in the air, gauging its rise and arc—and where it will fall. And what does the ball gain as it flies upward? Or lose when it plummets to earth?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What does the bubble gain from its existence? Or lose by bursting?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And the same for a candle.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. Turn it inside out: What is it like? What is it like old? Or sick? Or selling itself on the streets?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> They all die soon—praiser and praised, rememberer and remembered. Remembered in these parts or in a corner of them. Even there they don’t all agree with each other (or even with themselves).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And the whole earth a mere point in space.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22. Stick to what’s in front of you—idea, action, utterance.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22a. This is what you deserve. You could be good today. But instead you choose tomorrow.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. What I do? I attribute it to human beneficence.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What is done to me? I accept it—and attribute it to the gods, and that source from which all things together flow.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. Like the baths—oil, sweat, dirt, grayish water, all of it disgusting.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The whole of life, all of the visible world.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 25. Verus, leaving Lucilla behind, then Lucilla. Maximus, leaving Secunda. And Secunda. Diotimus, leaving Epitynchanus. Then Epitynchanus. Faustina, leaving Antoninus. Then Antoninus.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So with all of them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Hadrian, leaving Celer. And Celer.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Where have they gone, the brilliant, the insightful ones, the proud? Brilliant as Charax and Demetrius the Platonist and Eudaemon and the rest of them. Short-lived creatures, long dead. Some of them not remembered at all, some become legends, some lost even to legend.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So remember: your components will be scattered too, the life within you quenched. Or marching orders and another posting.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 26. Joy for humans lies in human actions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Human actions: kindness to others, contempt for the senses, the interrogation of appearances, observation of nature and of events in nature.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 27. Three relationships:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> i. with the body you inhabit;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> ii. with the divine, the cause of everything in all things;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> iii. with the people around you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 28. Either pain affects the body (which is the body’s problem) or it affects the soul. But the soul can choose not to be affected, preserving its own serenity, its own tranquillity. All our decisions, urges, desires, aversions lie within. No evil can touch them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 29. To erase false perceptions, tell yourself: I have it in me to keep my soul from evil, lust and all confusion. To see things as they are and treat them as they deserve. Don’t overlook this innate ability.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 30. To speak to the Senate—or anyone—in the right tone, without being overbearing. To choose the right words.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 31. Augustus’s court: his wife, his daughter, his grandsons, his stepsons, his sister, Agrippa, the relatives, servants, friends, Areius, Maecenas, the doctors, the sacrificial priests . . . the whole court, dead.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And consider the others . . . not just the deaths of individuals (like the family of the Pompeys).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That line they write on tombs—“last surviving descendant.” Consider their ancestors’ anxiety—that there be a successor. But someone has to be the last. There, too, the death of a whole house.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 32. You have to assemble your life yourself—action by action. And be satisfied if each one achieves its goal, as far as it can. No one can keep that from happening.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —But there are external obstacles. . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to behaving with justice, self-control, and good sense.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —Well, but perhaps to some more concrete action.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But if you accept the obstacle and work with what you’re given, an alternative will present itself—another piece of what you’re trying to assemble. Action by action.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 33. To accept it without arrogance, to let it go with indifference.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 34. Have you ever seen a severed hand or foot, or a decapitated head, just lying somewhere far away from the body it belonged to . . . ? That’s what we do to ourselves—or try to—when we rebel against what happens to us, when we segregate ourselves. Or when we do something selfish.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> You have torn yourself away from unity—your natural state, one you were born to share in. Now you’ve cut yourself off from it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But you have one advantage here: you can reattach yourself. A privilege God has granted to no other part of no other whole—to be separated, cut away, and reunited. But look how he’s singled us out. He’s allowed us not to be broken off in the first place, and when we are he’s allowed us to return, to graft ourselves back on, and take up our old position once again: part of a whole.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 35. We have various abilities, present in all rational creatures as in the nature of rationality itself. And this is one of them. Just as nature takes every obstacle, every impediment, and works around it—turns it to its purposes, incorporates it into itself—so, too, a rational being can turn each setback into raw material and use it to achieve its goal.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 36. Don’t let your imagination be crushed by life as a whole. Don’t try to picture everything bad that could possibly happen. Stick with the situation at hand, and ask, “Why is this so unbearable? Why can’t I endure it?” You’ll be embarrassed to answer.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then remind yourself that past and future have no power over you. Only the present—and even that can be minimized. Just mark off its limits. And if your mind tries to claim that it can’t hold out against <em class="italic">that</em> . . . well, then, heap shame upon it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 37. Are Pantheia or Pergamos still keeping watch at the tomb of Verus? Chabrias or Diotimus at the tomb of Hadrian? Of course they aren’t. Would the emperors know it if they were?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And even if they knew, would it please them?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And even if it did, would the mourners live forever? Were they, too, not fated to grow old and then die? And when that happened, what would the emperors do?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 38. The stench of decay. Rotting meat in a bag.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Look at it clearly. If you can.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 39. “To the best of my judgment, when I look at the human character I see no virtue placed there to counter justice. But I see one to counter pleasure: self-control.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 40. Stop perceiving the pain you imagine and you’ll remain completely unaffected.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —“You?”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Your <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —But I’m not just <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Fine. Just don’t let the <em class="italic">logos </em>be injured. If anything else is, let it decide that for itself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 41. For animate beings, “harmful” is whatever obstructs the operation of their senses—or the fulfillment of what they intend. Similar obstructions constitute harm to plants. So too for rational creatures, anything that obstructs the operation of the mind is harmful.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Apply this to yourself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Do pain and pleasure have their hooks in you? Let the senses deal with it. Are there obstacles to your action? If you failed to reckon with the possibility, then that would harm you, as a rational being. But if you use common sense, you haven’t been harmed or even obstructed. No one can obstruct the operations of the mind. Nothing can get at them—not fire or steel, not tyrants, not abuse—nothing. As long as it’s “a sphere . . . in perfect stillness.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 42. I have no right to do myself an injury. Have I ever injured anyone else if I could avoid it?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 43. People find pleasure in different ways. I find it in keeping my mind clear. In not turning away from people or the things that happen to them. In accepting and welcoming everything I see. In treating each thing as it deserves.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 44. Give yourself a gift: the present moment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> People out for posthumous fame forget that the Generations To Come will be the same annoying people they know now. And just as mortal.

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 45. Lift me up and hurl me. Wherever you will. My spirit will be gracious to me there—gracious and satisfied—as long as its existence and actions match its nature.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Is there any reason why my soul should suffer and be degraded—miserable, tense, huddled, frightened? How could there be?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 46. What humans experience is part of human experience. The experience of the ox is part of the experience of oxen, as the vine’s is of the vine, and the stone’s what is proper to stones.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Nothing that can happen is unusual or unnatural, and there’s no sense in complaining. Nature does not make us endure the unendurable.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 47. External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then depart, with a good conscience, as if you’d done it, embracing the obstacles too.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 48. Remember that when it withdraws into itself and finds contentment there, the mind is invulnerable.

That—but not that it’s done you any harm. The fact that my son is sick—that I can see. But “that he might die of it,” no. Stick with first impressions. Don’t extrapolate. And nothing can happen to you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or extrapolate. From a knowledge of all that can happen in the world.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 50. The cucumber is bitter? Then throw it out.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That’s all you need to know. Nothing more. Don’t demand to know “why such things exist.” Anyone who understands the world will laugh at you, just as a carpenter would if you seemed shocked at finding sawdust in his workshop, or a shoemaker at scraps of leather left over from work.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Of course, they have a place to dispose of these; nature has no door to sweep things out of. But the wonderful thing about its workmanship is how, faced with that limitation, it takes everything within it that seems broken, old and useless, transforms it into itself, and makes new things from it. So that it doesn’t need material from any outside source, or anywhere to dispose of what’s left over. It relies on itself for all it needs: space, material, and labor.</span></p></div>

To join ourselves not just to the air surrounding us, through breath, but to the reason that embraces all things, through thought.
