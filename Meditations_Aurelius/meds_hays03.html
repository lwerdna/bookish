<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Not just that every day more of our life is used up and less and less of it is left, but this too: if we live longer, can we be sure our mind will still be up to understanding the world—to the contemplation that aims at divine and human knowledge? If our mind starts to wander, we’ll still go on breathing, go on eating, imagining things, feeling urges and so on. But getting the most out of ourselves, calculating where our duty lies, analyzing what we hear and see, deciding whether it’s time to call it quits—all the things you need a healthy mind for . . . all those are gone.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So we need to hurry.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. We should remember that even Nature’s inadvertence has its own charm, its own attractiveness. The way loaves of bread split open on top in the oven; the ridges are just by-products of the baking, and yet pleasing, somehow: they rouse our appetite without our knowing why.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or how ripe figs begin to burst.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And olives on the point of falling: the shadow of decay gives them a peculiar beauty.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Stalks of wheat bending under their own weight. The furrowed brow of the lion. Flecks of foam on the boar’s mouth.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And other things. If you look at them in isolation there’s nothing beautiful about them, and yet by supplementing nature they enrich it and draw us in. And anyone with a feeling for nature—a deeper sensitivity—will find it all gives pleasure. Even what seems inadvertent. He’ll find the jaws of live animals as beautiful as painted ones or sculptures. He’ll look calmly at the distinct beauty of old age in men, women, and at the loveliness of children. And other things like that will call out to him constantly—things unnoticed by others. Things seen only by those at home with Nature and its works.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Hippocrates cured many illnesses—and then fell ill and died. The Chaldaeans predicted the deaths of many others; in due course their own hour arrived. Alexander, Pompey, Caesar—who utterly destroyed so many cities, cut down so many thousand foot and horse in battle—they too departed this life. Heraclitus often told us the world would end in fire. But it was moisture that carried him off; he died smeared with cowshit. Democritus was killed by ordinary vermin, Socrates by the human kind.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> You boarded, you set sail, you’ve made the passage. Time to disembark. If it’s for another life, well, there’s nowhere without gods on that side either. If to nothingness, then you no longer have to put up with pain and pleasure, or go on dancing attendance on this battered crate, your body—so much inferior to that which serves it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> One is mind and spirit, the other earth and garbage.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about other people—unless it affects the common good. It will keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and keep you from focusing on your own mind.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought: everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it would be obvious at once from your answer that your thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be ashamed to be caught thinking.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Someone like that—someone who refuses to put off joining the elect—is a kind of priest, a servant of the gods, in touch with what is within him and what keeps a person undefiled by pleasures, invulnerable to any pain, untouched by arrogance, unaffected by meanness, an athlete in the greatest of all contests—the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens. With what leaves us dyed indelibly by justice, welcoming wholeheartedly whatever comes—whatever we’re assigned—not worrying too often, or with any selfish motive, about what other people say. Or do, or think.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> He does only what is his to do, and considers constantly what the world has in store for him—doing his best, and trusting that all is <em class="italic">for</em> the best. For we carry our fate with us—and it carries us.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> He keeps in mind that all rational things are related, and that to care for all human beings is part of being human. Which doesn’t mean we have to share their opinions. We should listen only to those whose lives conform to nature. And the others? He bears in mind what sort of people they are—both at home and abroad, by night as well as day—and who they spend their time with. And he cares nothing for their praise—men who can’t even meet their own standards.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. How to act:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Never under compulsion, out of selfishness, without forethought, with misgivings.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Don’t gussy up your thoughts.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No surplus words or unnecessary actions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Let the spirit in you represent a man, an adult, a citizen, a Roman, a ruler. Taking up his post like a soldier and patiently awaiting his recall from life. Needing no oath or witness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Cheerfulness. Without requiring other people’s help. Or serenity supplied by others.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To stand up straight—not straightened.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage—than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control—if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing indeed—and enjoy it to the full.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But if nothing presents itself that’s superior to the spirit that lives within—the one that has subordinated individual desires to itself, that discriminates among impressions, that has broken free of physical temptations (as Socrates used to say), and subordinated itself to the gods, and looks out for human beings’ welfare—if you find that there’s nothing more important or valuable than that . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> . . . then don’t make room for anything but it—for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours. It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness—as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to it. Choose what’s best. </span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —Best is what benefits <em class="italic">me</em>.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> As a rational being? Then follow through. Or just as an animal? Then say so and stand your ground without making a show of it. (Just make sure you’ve done your homework first.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. Never regard something as doing you good if it makes you betray a trust, or lose your sense of shame, or makes you show hatred, suspicion, ill will, or hypocrisy, or a desire for things best done behind closed doors. If you can privilege your own mind, your guiding spirit and your reverence for its powers, that should keep you clear of dramatics, of wailing and gnashing of teeth. You won’t need solitude—or a cast of thousands, either. Above all, you’ll be free of fear and desire. And how long your body will contain the soul that inhabits it will cause you not a moment’s worry. If it’s time for you to go, leave willingly—as you would to accomplish anything that can be done with grace and honor. And concentrate on this, your whole life long: for your mind to be in the right state—the state a rational, civic mind should be in.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. The mind of one set straight and purified: no pus, no dirt, no scabs.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And not a life cut short by death, like an actor who stops before the play is done, the plot wound up.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Neither servility nor arrogance. Neither cringing nor disdain. Neither excuses nor evasions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. Your ability to control your thoughts—treat it with respect. It’s all that protects your mind from false perceptions—false to your nature, and that of all rational beings. It’s what makes thoughtfulness possible, and affection for other people, and submission to the divine.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. To the stand-bys above, add this one: always to define whatever it is we perceive—to trace its outline—so we can see what it really is: its substance. Stripped bare. As a whole. Unmodified. And to call it by its name—the thing itself and its components, to which it will eventually return. Nothing is so conducive to spiritual growth as this capacity for logical and accurate analysis of everything that happens to us. To look at it in such a way that we understand what need it fulfills, and in what kind of world. And its value to that world as a whole and to man in particular—as a citizen of that higher city, of which all other cities are mere households.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What is it—this thing that now forces itself on my notice? What is it made up of? How long was it designed to last? And what qualities do I need to bring to bear on it—tranquillity, courage, honesty, trustworthiness, straightforwardness, independence or what?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So in each case you need to say: “This is due to God.” Or: “This is due to the interweavings and intertwinings of fate, to coincidence or chance.” Or: “This is due to a human being. Someone of the same race, the same birth, the same society, but who doesn’t know what nature requires of him. But I do. And so I’ll treat them as the law that binds us—the law of nature—requires. With kindness and with justice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And in inconsequential things? I’ll do my best to treat them as they deserve.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. If you do the job in a principled way, with diligence, energy and patience, if you keep yourself free of distractions, and keep the spirit inside you undamaged, as if you might have to give it back at any moment—</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If you can embrace this without fear or expectation—can find fulfillment in what you’re doing now, as Nature intended, and in superhuman truthfulness (every word, every utterance)—then your life will be happy.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No one can prevent that.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. Doctors keep their scalpels and other instruments handy, for emergencies. Keep your philosophy ready too—ready to understand heaven and earth. In everything you do, even the smallest thing, remember the chain that links them. Nothing earthly succeeds by ignoring heaven, nothing heavenly by ignoring the earth.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. Stop drifting. You’re not going to re-read your <em class="italic">Brief Comments,</em> your <em class="italic">Deeds of the Ancient Greeks and Romans,</em> the commonplace books you saved for your old age. Sprint for the finish. Write off your hopes, and if your well-being matters to you, be your own savior while you can.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. They don’t realize how much is included in <em class="italic">stealing, sowing, buying, resting, seeing to business</em> (not with the eyes, but another kind of sight).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. Body. Soul. Mind.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Sensations: the body.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Desires: the soul.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Reasoning: the mind.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To experience sensations: even grazing beasts do that. To let your desires control you: even wild animals do that—and rutting humans, and tyrants (from Phalaris to Nero . . .).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To make your mind your guide to what seems best: even people who deny the gods do that. Even people who betray their country. Even people who do &lt;. . .&gt; behind closed doors.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If all the rest is common coin, then what is unique to the good man?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To welcome with affection what is sent by fate. Not to stain or disturb the spirit within him with a mess of false beliefs. Instead, to preserve it faithfully, by calmly obeying God—saying nothing untrue, doing nothing unjust. And if the others don’t acknowledge it—this life lived with simplicity, humility, cheerfulness—he doesn’t resent them for it, and isn’t deterred from following the road where it leads: to the end of life. An end to be approached in purity, in serenity, in acceptance, in peaceful unity with what must be.</span></p></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_14"></div>
