<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it—and makes it burn still higher.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. No random actions, none not based on underlying principles.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. People try to get away from it all—to the country, to the beach, to the mountains. You always wish that you could too. Which is idiotic: you can get away from it anytime you like.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> By going within.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Nowhere you can go is more peaceful—more free of interruptions—than your own soul. Especially if you have other things to rely on. An instant’s recollection and there it is: complete tranquillity. And by tranquillity I mean a kind of harmony.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So keep getting away from it all—like that. Renew yourself. But keep it brief and basic. A quick visit should be enough to ward off all &lt; . . . &gt; and send you back ready to face what awaits you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What’s there to complain about? People’s misbehavior? But take into consideration:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • that rational beings exist for one another;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • that doing what’s right sometimes requires patience;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • that no one does the wrong thing deliberately;</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • and the number of people who have feuded and envied and hated and fought and died and been buried.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> . . . and keep your mouth shut.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or are you complaining about the things the world assigns you? But consider the two options: Providence or atoms. And all the arguments for seeing the world as a city.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or is it your body? Keep in mind that when the mind detaches itself and realizes its own nature, it no longer has anything to do with ordinary life—the rough and the smooth, either one. And remember all you’ve been taught—and accepted—about pain and pleasure.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perceptions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> “The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. If thought is something we share, then so is reason—what makes us reasoning beings.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If so, then the reason that tells us what to do and what not to do is also shared.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if so, we share a common law.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And thus, are fellow citizens.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And fellow citizens of something.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And in that case, our state must be the world. What other entity could all of humanity belong to? And from it—from this state that we share—come thought and reason and law.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Where else could they come from? The earth that composes me derives from earth, the water from some other element, the air from its own source, the heat and fire from theirs—since nothing comes from nothing, or returns to it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So thought must derive from somewhere else as well.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. Death: something like birth, a natural mystery, elements that split and recombine.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not an embarrassing thing. Not an offense to reason, or our nature.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. That sort of person is bound to do that. You might as well resent a fig tree for secreting juice. (Anyway, before very long you’ll both be dead—dead and soon forgotten.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. Choose not to be harmed—and you won’t feel harmed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Don’t feel harmed—and you haven’t been.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. It can ruin your life only if it ruins your character. Otherwise it cannot harm you—inside or out.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. It was for the best. So Nature had no choice but to do it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. That every event is the right one. Look closely and you’ll see.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not just the right one overall, but <em class="italic">right.</em> As if someone had weighed it out with scales.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Keep looking closely like that, and embody it in your actions: goodness—what defines a good person.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Keep to it in everything you do.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. Not what your enemy sees and hopes that you will, but what’s really there.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. Two kinds of readiness are constantly needed: (i) to do only what the <em class="italic">logos</em> of authority and law directs, with the good of human beings in mind; (ii) to reconsider your position, when someone can set you straight or convert you to his. But your conversion should always rest on a conviction that it’s right, or benefits others—nothing else. Not because it’s more appealing or more popular.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. You have a mind?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —Yes.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Well, why not use it? Isn’t that all you want—for it to do its job?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. You have functioned as a part of something; you will vanish into what produced you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or be restored, rather.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To the <em class="italic">logos</em> from which all things spring<em class="italic">.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> By being changed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles now, one later, but it makes no difference.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. Now they see you as a beast, a monkey. But in a week they’ll think you’re a god—if you rediscover your beliefs and honor the <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. Not to live as if you had endless years ahead of you. Death overshadows you. While you’re alive and able—be good.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. The tranquillity that comes when you stop caring what they say. Or think, or do. Only what <em class="italic">you</em> do. (Is this fair? Is this the right thing to do?)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> &lt; . . . &gt; not to be distracted by their darkness. To run straight for the finish line, unswerving.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don’t just mean when you’re dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> “ You’re out of step—neglecting the gifts of nature to hand on someone’s words in the future. “</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. Beautiful things of any kind are beautiful in themselves and sufficient to themselves. Praise is extraneous. The object of praise remains what it was—no better and no worse. This applies, I think, even to “beautiful” things in ordinary life—physical objects, artworks.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No more than justice does—or truth, or kindness, or humility. Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. If our souls survive, how does the air find room for them—all of them—since the beginning of time?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> How does the earth find room for all the bodies buried in it since the beginning of time? They linger for whatever length of time, and then, through change and decomposition, make room for others. So too with the souls that inhabit the air. They linger a little, and then are changed—diffused and kindled into fire, absorbed into the <em class="italic">logos</em> from which all things spring, and so make room for new arrivals.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> One possible answer.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But we shouldn’t think only of the mass of <em class="italic">buried</em> bodies. There are the ones consumed, on a daily basis, by us and by other animals. How many are swallowed up like that, entombed in the bodies of those nourished by them, and yet there is room for them all—converted into flesh and blood, transformed to air and fire.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> How is the truth of this determined?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Through analysis: material and cause.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22. Not to be driven this way and that, but always to behave with justice and see things as they are.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. To the world: Your harmony is mine. Whatever time you choose is the right time. Not late, not early.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To nature: What the turn of your seasons brings me falls like ripe fruit. All things are born from you, exist in you, return to you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The poet says “dear city of Cecrops . . .” Can’t you bring yourself to say “of Zeus”?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the <em class="italic">logos</em> of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 25. And then you might see what the life of the good man is like—someone content with what nature assigns him, and satisfied with being just and kind himself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 26. You’ve seen that. Now look at this.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Don’t be disturbed. Uncomplicate yourself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Someone has done wrong . . . to himself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Something happens to you. Good. It was meant for you by nature, woven into the pattern from the beginning.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Life is short. That’s all there is to say. Get what you can from the present—thoughtfully, justly.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Unrestrained moderation.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 27. An ordered world or a mishmash. But still an order. Can there be order within you and not in everything else? In things so different, so dispersed, so intertwined?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 28. Character: dark, womanish, obstinate. Wolf, sheep, child, fool, cheat, buffoon, salesman, tyrant.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 29. Alien: (n.) one who doesn’t know what the world contains. Or how it operates.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Fugitive: (n.) one who evades his obligations to others.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Blind: (adj.) one who keeps the eyes of his mind shut tight.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Poor: (adj.) requiring others; not having the necessities of life in one’s own possession.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Rebel: (n.) one who is rebellious, one who withdraws from the <em class="italic">logos</em> of Nature because he resents its workings. (It produced you; now it produces this.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Schismatic: (n.) one who separates his own soul from others with the <em class="italic">logos.</em> They should be one.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 30. A philosopher without clothes and one without books. “I have nothing to eat,” says he, as he stands there half-naked, “but I subsist on the <em class="italic">logos</em>.” And with nothing to read, I subsist on it too.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 31. Love the discipline you know, and let it support you. Entrust everything willingly to the gods, and then make your way through life—no one’s master and no one’s slave.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 32. The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the exact same things: marrying, raising children, getting sick, dying, waging war, throwing parties, doing business, farming, flattering, boasting, distrusting, plotting, hoping others will die, complaining about their own lives, falling in love, putting away money, seeking high office and power.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And that life they led is nowhere to be found.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life too—gone.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Survey the records of other eras. And see how many others gave their all and soon died and decomposed into the elements that formed them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But most of all, run through the list of those you knew yourself. Those who worked in vain, who failed to do what they should have—what they should have remained fixed on and found satisfaction in.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 33. Words once in common use now sound archaic. And the names of the famous dead as well: Camillus, Caeso, Volesus, Dentatus . . . Scipio and Cato . . . Augustus . . . Hadrian and Antoninus, and . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then what should we work for?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 34. Hand yourself over to Clotho voluntarily, and let her spin you into whatever she pleases.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 35. Everything transitory—the knower and the known.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 36. Constant awareness that everything is born from change. The knowledge that there is nothing nature loves more than to alter what exists and make new things like it. All that exists is the seed of what will emerge from it. You think the only seeds are the ones that make plants or children? Go deeper.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 37. On the verge of dying and still weighed down, still turbulent, still convinced external things can harm you, still rude to other people, still not acknowledging the truth: that wisdom is justice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 38. Look into their minds, at what the wise do and what they don’t.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 39. Nothing that goes on in anyone else’s mind can harm you. Nor can the shifts and changes in the world around you.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone—bad and good alike—is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither natural nor unnatural.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 40. The world as a living being—one nature, one soul. Keep that in mind. And how everything feeds into that single experience, moves with a single motion. And how everything helps produce everything else. Spun and woven together.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 41. “A little wisp of soul carrying a corpse.”—Epictetus.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 42. There is nothing bad in undergoing change—or good in emerging from it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 43. Time is a river, a violent current of events, glimpsed once and already carried past us, and another follows and is gone.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 44. Everything that happens is as simple and familiar as the rose in spring, the fruit in summer: disease, death, blasphemy, conspiracy . . . everything that makes stupid people happy or angry.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 45. What follows coheres with what went before. Not like a random catalogue whose order is imposed upon it arbitrarily, but logically connected. And just as what exists is ordered and harmonious, what comes into being betrays an order too. Not a mere sequence, but an astonishing concordance.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 46. Remember Heraclitus: “When earth dies, it becomes water; water, air; air, fire; and back to the beginning.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> “Those who have forgotten where the road leads.”</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 47. Suppose that a god announced that you were going to die tomorrow “or the day after.” Unless you were a complete coward you wouldn’t kick up a fuss about which day it was—what difference could it make? Now recognize that the difference between years from now and tomorrow is just as small.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 48. Don’t let yourself forget how many doctors have died, after furrowing their brows over how many deathbeds. How many astrologers, after pompous forecasts about others’ ends. How many philosophers, after endless disquisitions on death and immortality. How many warriors, after inflicting thousands of casualties themselves. How many tyrants, after abusing the power of life and death atrociously, as if they were themselves immortal.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> How many whole cities have met their end: Helike, Pompeii, Herculaneum, and countless others.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And all the ones you know yourself, one after another. One who laid out another for burial, and was buried himself, and then the man who buried him—all in the same short space of time.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it upwithout complaint.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Like an olive that ripens and falls.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 49. To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 49a. —It’s unfortunate that this has happened.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No. It’s fortunate that this has happened and I’ve remained unharmed by it—not shattered by the present or frightened of the future. It could have happened to anyone. But not everyone could have remained unharmed by it. Why treat the one as a misfortune rather than the other as fortunate? Can you really call something a misfortune that doesn’t violate human nature? Or do you think something that’s not against nature’s will can violate it? But you know what its will is. Does what’s happened keep you from acting with justice, generosity, self-control, sanity, prudence, honesty, humility, straightforwardness, and all the other qualities that allow a person’s nature to fulfill itself?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So remember this principle when something threatens to cause you pain: the thing itself was no misfortune at all; to endure it and prevail is great good fortune.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 50. A trite but effective tactic against the fear of death: think of the list of people who had to be pried away from life. What did they gain by dying old? In the end, they all sleep six feet under—Caedicianus, Fabius, Julian, Lepidus, and all the rest. They buried their contemporaries, and were buried in turn.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Our lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these circumstances, among these people, in this body? Nothing to get excited about. Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what’s the difference?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 51. Take the shortest route, the one that nature planned—to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculation and pretension.</span></p></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_17"></div>
