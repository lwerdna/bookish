<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Her reverence for the divine, her generosity, her inability not only to do wrong but even to conceive of doing it. And the simple way she lived—not in the least like the rich.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To avoid the public schools, to hire good private teachers, and to accept the resulting costs as money well-spent.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to support this side or that in chariot-racing, this fighter or that in the games. To put up with discomfort and not make demands. To do my own work, mind my own business, and have no time for slanderers.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. DIOGNETUS</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to waste time on nonsense. Not to be taken in by conjurors and hoodoo artists with their talk about incantations and exorcism and all the rest of it. Not to be obsessed with quail-fighting or other crazes like that. To hear unwelcome truths. To practice philosophy, and to study with Baccheius, and then with Tandasis and Marcianus. To write dialogues as a student. To choose the Greek lifestyle—the camp-bed and the cloak.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to be sidetracked by my interest in rhetoric. Not to write treatises on abstract questions, or deliver moralizing little sermons, or compose imaginary descriptions of The Simple Life or The Man Who Lives Only for Others. To steer clear of oratory, poetry and <em class="italic">belles lettres.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to dress up just to stroll around the house, or things like that. To write straightforward letters (like the one he sent my mother from Sinuessa). And to behave in a conciliatory way when people who have angered or annoyed us want to make up.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To read attentively—not to be satisfied with “just getting the gist of it.” And not to fall for every smooth talker.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And for introducing me to Epictetus’s lectures—and loaning me his own copy.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Independence and unvarying reliability, and to pay attention to nothing, no matter how fleetingly, except the <em class="italic">logos.</em> And to be the same in all circumstances—intense pain, the loss of a child, chronic illness. And to see clearly, from his example, that a man can show both strength and flexibility.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His patience in teaching. And to have seen someone who clearly viewed his expertise and ability as a teacher as the humblest of virtues.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And to have learned how to accept favors from friends without losing your self-respect or appearing ungrateful.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Gravity without airs.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To show intuitive sympathy for friends, tolerance to amateurs and sloppy thinkers. His ability to get along with everyone: sharing his company was the highest of compliments, and the opportunity an honor for those around him.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To investigate and analyze, with understanding and logic, the principles we ought to live by.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to display anger or other emotions. To be free of passion and yet full of love.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. THE LITERARY CRITIC ALEXANDER</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to be constantly correcting people, and in particular not to jump on them whenever they make an error of usage or a grammatical mistake or mispronounce something, but just answer their question or add another example, or debate the issue itself (not their phrasing), or make some other contribution to the discussion—and insert the right expression, unobtrusively.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. FRONTO</span></p></div>

<br class="calibre5"/>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. ALEXANDER THE PLATONIST</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not to be constantly telling people (or writing them) that I’m too busy, unless I really am. Similarly, not to be always ducking my responsibilities to the people around me because of “pressing business.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To show your teachers ungrudging respect (the Domitius and Athenodotus story), and your children unfeigned love.</span></p></div>

<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. [MY BROTHER] SEVERUS</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To love my family, truth and justice. It was through him that I encountered Thrasea, Helvidius, Cato, Dion and Brutus, and conceived of a society of equal laws, governed by equality of status and of speech, and of rulers who respect the liberty of their subjects above all else.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And from him as well, to be steady and consistent in valuing philosophy.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And to help others and be eager to share, not to be a pessimist, and never to doubt your friends’ affection for you. And that when people incurred his disapproval, they always knew it. And that his friends never had to speculate about his attitude to anything: it was always clear.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Optimism in adversity—especially illness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A personality in balance: dignity and grace together.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Doing your job without whining.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Other people’s certainty that what he said was what he thought, and what he did was done without malice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Never taken aback or apprehensive. Neither rash nor hesitant—or bewildered, or at a loss. Not obsequious—but not aggressive or paranoid either.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Generosity, charity, honesty.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The sense he gave of <em class="italic">staying</em> on the path rather than being <em class="italic">kept</em> on it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That no one could ever have felt patronized by him—or in a position to patronize him.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A sense of humor.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_11"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. MY ADOPTED FATHER</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Compassion. Unwavering adherence to decisions, once he’d reached them. Indifference to superficial honors. Hard work. Persistence.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Listening to anyone who could contribute to the public good.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His dogged determination to treat people as they deserved.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A sense of when to push and when to back off.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Putting a stop to the pursuit of boys.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His altruism. Not expecting his friends to keep him entertained at dinner or to travel with him (unless they wanted to). And anyone who had to stay behind to take care of something always found him the same when he returned.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His searching questions at meetings. A kind of single-mindedness, almost, never content with first impressions, or breaking off the discussion prematurely.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His constancy to friends—never getting fed up with them, or playing favorites. </span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Self-reliance, always. And cheerfulness.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And his advance planning (well in advance) and his discreet attention to even minor things.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His restrictions on acclamations—and all attempts to flatter him.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His constant devotion to the empire’s needs. His stewardship of the treasury. His willingness to take responsibility—and blame—for both.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His attitude to the gods: no superstitiousness. And his attitude to men: no demagoguery, no currying favor, no pandering. Always sober, always steady, and never vulgar or a prey to fads.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The way he handled the material comforts that fortune had supplied him in such abundance—without arrogance and without apology. If they were there, he took advantage of them. If not, he didn’t miss them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No one ever called him glib, or shameless, or pedantic. They saw him for what he was: a man tested by life, accomplished, unswayed by flattery, qualified to govern both himself and them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His respect for people who practiced philosophy—at least, those who were sincere about it. But without denigrating the others—or listening to them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His ability to feel at ease with people—and put them at <em class="italic">their</em> ease, without being pushy.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> His willingness to take adequate care of himself. Not a hypochondriac or obsessed with his appearance, but not ignoring things either. With the result that he hardly ever needed medical attention, or drugs or any sort of salve or ointment.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> This, in particular: his willingness to yield the floor to experts—in oratory, law, psychology, whatever—and to support them energetically, so that each of them could fulfill his potential.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That he respected tradition without needing to constantly congratulate himself for Safeguarding Our Traditional Values.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Not prone to go off on tangents, or pulled in all directions, but sticking with the same old places and the same old things.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The way he could have one of his migraines and then go right back to what he was doing—fresh and at the top of his game.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That he had so few secrets—only state secrets, in fact, and not all that many of those.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The way he kept public actions within reasonable bounds—games, building projects, distributions of money and so on—because he looked to what needed doing and not the credit to be gained from doing it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No bathing at strange hours, no self-indulgent building projects, no concern for food, or the cut and color of his clothes, or having attractive slaves. (The robe from his farm at Lorium, most of the things at Lanuvium, the way he accepted the customs agent’s apology at Tusculum, etc.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> He never exhibited rudeness, lost control of himself, or turned violent. No one ever saw him sweat. Everything was to be approached logically and with due consideration, in a calm and orderly fashion but decisively, and with no loose ends.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> You could have said of him (as they say of Socrates) that he knew how to enjoy and abstain from things that most people find it hard to abstain from and all too easy to enjoy. Strength, perseverance, self-control in both areas: the mark of a soul in readiness—indomitable.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. THE GODS</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I had good grandparents, a good mother and father, a good sister, good teachers, good servants, relatives, friends—almost without exception. And that I never lost control of myself with any of them, although I had it in me to do that, and I might have, easily. But thanks to the gods, I was never put in that position, and so escaped the test.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I wasn’t raised by my grandfather’s girlfriend for longer than I was. That I didn’t lose my virginity too early, and didn’t enter adulthood until it was time—put it off, even.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I had someone—as a ruler and as a father—who could keep me from being arrogant and make me realize that even at court you can live without a troop of bodyguards, and gorgeous clothes, lamps, sculpture—the whole charade. That you can behave almost like an ordinary person without seeming slovenly or careless as a ruler or when carrying out official obligations.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I had the kind of brother I did. One whose character challenged me to improve my own. One whose love and affection enriched my life.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That my children weren’t born stupid or physically deformed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I wasn’t more talented in rhetoric or poetry, or other areas. If I’d felt that I was making better progress I might never have given them up.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I conferred on the people who brought me up the honors they seemed to want early on, instead of putting them off (since they were still young) with the hope that I’d do it later.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I knew Apollonius, and Rusticus, and Maximus.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I was shown clearly and often what it would be like to live as nature requires. The gods did all they could—through their gifts, their help, their inspiration—to ensure that I could live as nature demands. And if I’ve failed, it’s no one’s fault but mine. Because I didn’t pay attention to what they told me—to what they taught me, practically, step by step.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That my body has held out, especially considering the life I’ve led.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I never laid a finger on Benedicta or on Theodotus. And that even later, when I was overcome by passion, I recovered from it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That even though I was often upset with Rusticus I never did anything I would have regretted later.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That even though she died young, at least my mother spent her last years with me.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That whenever I felt like helping someone who was short of money, or otherwise in need, I never had to be told that I had no resources to do it with. And that I was never put in that position myself—of having to take something from someone else.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That I have the wife I do: obedient, loving, humble.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That my children had competent teachers.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Remedies granted through dreams—when I was coughing blood, for instance, and having fits of dizziness. And the one at Caieta.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That when I became interested in philosophy I didn’t fall into the hands of charlatans, and didn’t get bogged down in writing treatises, or become absorbed by logic-chopping, or preoccupied with physics.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> All things for which “we need the help of fortune and the gods.”</span></p></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_8"></div>
