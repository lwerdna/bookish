# TLDR

index.md and index.html contain Aurelius's Meditations: difficult translation on left, easier translation on right.

# Background

After reading the Dover Thrift edition, and finding it difficult, I then
discovered that there are other translations out there, one in particular
being very friendly.

The Dover edition, like a few others I found, is a George Long translation
with some added fixes.

* George Long's original is "The Thoughts of the Emperor M. Aurelius Antoninus" by Bell of London in 1862
* George Long, [MIT Classics](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.mb.txt) published at unknown date but is missing the last 9 verses in book 12
* Dover edition is the George Long, "revised and updated" in 1997
* George Long, [University of Adelaide](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/marcus_aurelius/meditations/) last updated 2014
* [Gregory Hays](http://people.virginia.edu/~bgh2n/) published by Modern Library in 2003.

The George long translations appear 

# Then what is this? 

The left column is the MIT edition with a few punctuation fixes, and the Adelaide edition filling in this missing part at the end of book 12.

The right column is the Hays translation.
