<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. Evil: the same old thing.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> No matter what happens, keep this in mind: It’s the same old thing, from one end of the world to the other. It fills the history books, ancient and modern, and the cities, and the houses too. Nothing new at all.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Familiar, transient.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. You cannot quench understanding unless you put out the insights that compose it. But you can rekindle those at will, like glowing coals. I can control my thoughts as necessary; then how can I be troubled? What is outside my mind means nothing to it. Absorb that lesson and your feet stand firm.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> You can return to life. Look at things as you did before. And life returns.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Pointless bustling of processions, opera arias, herds of sheep and cattle, military exercises. A bone flung to pet poodles, a little food in the fish tank. The miserable servitude of ants, scampering of frightened mice, puppets jerked on strings.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Surrounded as we are by all of this, we need to practice acceptance. Without disdain. But remembering that our own worth is measured by what we devote our energy to.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. Focus on what is said when you speak and on what results from each action. Know what the one aims at, and what the other means.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. Is my intellect up to this? If so, then I’ll put it to work, like a tool provided by nature. And if it isn’t, then I’ll turn the job over to someone who can do better—unless I have no choice.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or I do the best I can with it, and collaborate with whoever can make use of it, to do what the community needs done. Because whatever I do—alone or with others—can aim at one thing only: what squares with those requirements.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. So many who were remembered already forgotten, and those who remembered them long gone.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. Don’t be ashamed to need help. Like a soldier storming a wall, you have a mission to accomplish. And if you’ve been wounded and you need a comrade to pull you up? So what?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. Forget the future. When and if it comes, you’ll have the same resources to draw on—the same <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. Everything is interwoven, and the web is holy; none of its parts are unconnected. They are composed harmoniously, and together they compose the world.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> One world, made up of all things.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> One divinity, present in them all.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> One substance and one law—the <em class="italic">logos</em> that all rational beings share.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And one truth . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If this is indeed the culmination of one process, beings who share the same birth, the same <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. All substance is soon absorbed into nature, all that animates it soon restored to the <em class="italic">logos, </em>all trace of them both soon covered over by time.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. To a being with <em class="italic">logos,</em> an unnatural action is one that conflicts with the <em class="italic">logos.</em></span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. Straight, not straightened.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. What is rational in different beings is related, like the individual limbs of a single being, and meant to function as a unit.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> This will be clearer to you if you remind yourself: I am a single limb (<em class="italic">melos</em>) of a larger body—a rational one.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or you could say “a part” (<em class="italic">meros</em>)—only a letter’s difference. But then you’re not really embracing other people. Helping them isn’t yet its own reward. You’re still seeing it only as The Right Thing To Do. You don’t yet realize who you’re really helping.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. Let it happen, if it wants, to whatever it can happen to. And what’s affected can complain about it if it wants. It doesn’t hurt me unless I interpret its happening as harmful to me. I can choose not to.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be good. Like gold or emerald or purple repeating to itself, “No matter what anyone says or does, my task is to be emerald, my color undiminished.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. The mind doesn’t get in its own way. It doesn’t frighten itself into desires. If other things can scare or hurt it, let them; it won’t go down that road on the basis of its own perceptions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Let the body avoid discomfort (if it can), and if it feels it, say so. But the soul is what feels fear and pain, and what conceives of them in the first place, and it suffers nothing. Because it will never conclude that it has.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> The mind in itself has no needs, except for those it creates itself. Is undisturbed, except for its own disturbances. Knows no obstructions, except those from within.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. Well-being is good luck, or good character.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17a. (But what are you doing here, Perceptions? Get back to where you came from, and good riddance. I don’t need you. Yes, I know, it was only force of habit that brought you. No, I’m not angry with you. Just go away.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. Frightened of change? But what can exist without it? What’s closer to nature’s heart? Can you take a hot bath and leave the firewood as it was? Eat food without transforming it? Can any vital process take place without something being changed?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Can’t you see? It’s just the same with you—and just as vital to nature.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. Carried through existence as through rushing rapids. All bodies. Which are sprung from nature and cooperate with it, as our limbs do with each other. Time has swallowed a Chrysippus, a Socrates and an Epictetus, many times over.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> For “Epictetus” read any person, and any thing.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. My only fear is doing something contrary to human nature—the wrong thing, the wrong way, or at the wrong time.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. Close to forgetting it all, close to being forgotten.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 22. To feel affection for people even when they make mistakes is uniquely human. You can do it, if you simply recognize: that they’re human too, that they act out of ignorance, against their will, and that you’ll both be dead before long. And, above all, that they haven’t really hurt you. They haven’t diminished your ability to choose.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. Nature takes substance and makes a horse. Like a sculptor with wax. And then melts it down and uses the material for a tree. Then for a person. Then for something else. Each existing only briefly.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> It does the container no harm to be put together, and none to be taken apart.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. Anger in the face is unnatural. † . . . † or in the end is put out for good, so that it can’t be rekindled. Try to conclude its unnaturalness from that. (If even the consciousness of acting badly has gone, why go on living?)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 25. Before long, nature, which controls it all, will alter everything you see and use it as material for something else—over and over again. So that the world is continually renewed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 26. When people injure you, ask yourself what good or harm they thought would come of it. If you understand that, you’ll feel sympathy rather than outrage or anger. Your sense of good and evil may be the same as theirs, or near it, in which case you have to excuse them. Or your sense of good and evil may differ from theirs. In which case they’re misguided and deserve your compassion. Is that so hard?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 27. Treat what you don’t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have, the things you value most, and think of how much you’d crave them if you didn’t have them. But be careful. Don’t feel such satisfaction that you start to overvalue them—that it would upset you to lose them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 28. Self-contraction: the mind’s requirements are satisfied by doing what we should, and by the calm it brings us.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 29. Discard your misperceptions.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Stop being jerked like a puppet.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Limit yourself to the present.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Understand what happens—to you, to others.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Analyze what exists, break it all down: material and cause.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Anticipate your final hours.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_10"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Other people’s mistakes? Leave them to their makers.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 30. To direct your thoughts to what is said. To focus the mind on what happens and what makes it happen.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 31. Wash yourself clean. With simplicity, with humility, with indifference to everything but right and wrong.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 31a. “ . . . all are relative,” it’s been said, “and in reality only atoms.” It’s enough to remember the first half: “all are relative.” “ Which is little enough. “</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 32. [On death:] If atoms, dispersed. If oneness, quenched or changed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 33. [On pain:] Unendurable pain brings its own end with it. Chronic pain is always endurable: the intelligence maintains serenity by cutting itself off from the body, the mind remains undiminished. And the parts that pain affects—let them speak for themselves, if they can.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 34. [On Ambition:] How their minds work, the things they long for and fear. Events like piles of sand, drift upon drift—each one soon hidden by the next.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 35. “ ‘If his mind is filled with nobility, with a grasp of all time, all existence, do you think our human life will mean much to him at all?’</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 37. Disgraceful: that the mind should control the face, should be able to shape and mold it as it pleases, but not shape and mold itself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 38. “And why should we feel anger at the world? As if the world would notice!”</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 40. “To harvest life like standing stalks of grain Grown and cut down in turn.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 41. “If I and my two children cannot move the gods The gods must have their reasons.”</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 45. “It’s like this, gentlemen of the jury: The spot where a person decides to station himself, or wherever his commanding officer stations him—well, I think that’s where he ought to take his stand and face the enemy, and not worry about being killed, or about anything but doing his duty.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 46. “But, my good friend, consider the possibility that nobility and virtue are not synonymous with the loss or preservation of one’s life. Is it not possible that a real man should forget about living a certain number of years, and should not cling to life, but leave it up to the gods, accepting, as women say, that ‘no one can escape his fate,’ and turn his attention to how he can best live the life before him?”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 47. To watch the courses of the stars as if you revolved with them. To keep constantly in mind how the elements alter into one another. Thoughts like this wash off the mud of life below.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 48. [Plato has it right.] If you want to talk about people, you need to look down on the earth from above. Herds, armies, farms; weddings, divorces, births, deaths; noisy courtrooms, desert places; all the foreign peoples; holidays, days of mourning, market days . . . all mixed together, a harmony of opposites.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 49. Look at the past—empire succeeding empire—and from that, extrapolate the future: the same thing. No escape from the rhythm of events.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Which is why observing life for forty years is as good as a thousand. Would you really see anything new?</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 64. For times when you feel pain:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> See that it doesn’t disgrace you, or degrade your intelligence—doesn’t keep it from acting rationally or unselfishly.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And in most cases what Epicurus said should help: that pain is neither unbearable nor unending, as long as you keep in mind its limits and don’t magnify them in your imagination.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And keep in mind too that pain often comes in disguise—as drowsiness, fever, loss of appetite. . . . When you’re bothered by things like that, remind yourself: “I’m giving in to pain.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 65. Take care that you don’t treat inhumanity as it treats human beings.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 66. How do we know that Telauges wasn’t a better man than Socrates?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> It’s not enough to ask whether Socrates’ death was nobler, whether he debated with the sophists more adeptly, whether he showed greater endurance by spending the night out in the cold, and when he was ordered to arrest the man from Salamis decided it was preferable to refuse, and “swaggered about the streets” (which one could reasonably doubt).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> What matters is what kind of soul he had.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Whether he was satisfied to treat men with justice and the gods with reverence and didn’t lose his temper unpredictably at evil done by others, didn’t make himself the slave of other people’s ignorance, didn’t treat anything that nature did as abnormal, or put up with it as an unbearable imposition, didn’t put his mind in his body’s keeping.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 67. Nature did not blend things so inextricably that you can’t draw your own boundaries—place your own well-being in your own hands. It’s quite possible to be a good man without anyone realizing it. Remember that.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And this too: you don’t need much to live happily. And just because you’ve abandoned your hopes of becoming a great thinker or scientist, don’t give up on attaining freedom, achieving humility, serving others, obeying God.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 68. To live life in peace, immune to all compulsion. Let them scream whatever they want. Let animals dismember this soft flesh that covers you. How would any of that stop you from keeping your mind calm—reliably sizing up what’s around you—and ready to make good use of whatever happens? So that Judgment can look the event in the eye and say, “This is what you really are, regardless of what you may look like.” While Adaptability adds, “You’re just what I was looking for.” Because to me the present is a chance for the exercise of rational virtue—civic virtue—in short, the art that men share with gods. Both treat whatever happens as wholly natural; not novel or hard to deal with, but familiar and easily handled.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 69. Perfection of character: to live your last day, every day, without frenzy, or sloth, or pretense.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 70. The gods live forever and yet they don’t seem annoyed at having to put up with human beings and their behavior throughout eternity. And not only put up with but actively care for them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And you—on the verge of death—you still refuse to care for them, although you’re one of them yourself.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 71. It’s silly to try to escape other people’s faults. They are inescapable. Just try to escape your own.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 72. Whenever the force that makes us rational and social encounters something that is neither, then it can reasonably regard it as inferior.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 73. You’ve given aid and they’ve received it. And yet, like an idiot, you keep holding out for more: to be credited with a Good Deed, to be repaid in kind. Why?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 74. No one objects to what is useful to him.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To be of use to others is natural.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then don’t object to what is useful to you—being of use.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 75. Nature willed the creation of the world. Either all that exists follows logically or even those things to which the world’s intelligence most directs its will are completely random.</span></p></div>
