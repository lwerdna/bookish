<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 1. To my soul:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Are you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be simple, whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that contains you? Know what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be fulfilled, ever stop desiring—lusting and longing for people and things to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept the present—all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever they decide and have in store for the preservation of that perfect entity—good and just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them, and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Will you ever take your stand as a fellow citizen with gods and human beings, blaming no one, deserving no one’s censure?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 2. Focus on what nature demands, as if you were governed by that alone. Then do that, and accept it, unless your nature as a living being would be degraded by it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Then focus on what <em class="italic">that</em> nature demands, and accept that too—unless your nature as a rational being would be degraded by it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And, of course, “rational” also implies “civic.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Follow these guidelines and don’t waste time on anything else.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 3. Everything that happens is either endurable or not.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If it’s endurable, then endure it. Stop complaining.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If it’s unendurable . . . then stop complaining. Your destruction will mean its end as well.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Just remember: you can endure anything your mind can make endurable, by treating it as in your interest to do so.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> In your interest, or in your nature.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 4. If they’ve made a mistake, correct them gently and show them where they went wrong. If you can’t do that, then the blame lies with you. Or no one.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 5. Whatever happens to you has been waiting to happen since the beginning of time. The twining strands of fate wove both of them together: your own existence and the things that happen to you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 6. Whether it’s atoms or nature, the first thing to be said is this: I am a part of a world controlled by nature. Secondly: that I have a relationship with other, similar parts. And with that in mind I have no right, as a part, to complain about what is assigned me by the whole. Because what benefits the whole can’t harm the parts, and the whole does nothing that doesn’t benefit it. That’s a trait shared by all natures, but the nature of the world is defined by a second characteristic as well: no outside force can compel it to cause itself harm.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So by keeping in mind the whole I form a part of, I’ll accept whatever happens. And because of my relationship to other parts, I will do nothing selfish, but aim instead to join them, to direct my every action toward what benefits us all and to avoid what doesn’t. If I do all that, then my life should go smoothly. As you might expect a citizen’s life to go—one whose actions serve his fellow citizens, and who embraces the community’s decree.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 7. The whole is compounded by nature of individual parts, whose destruction is inevitable (“destruction” here meaning transformation). If the process is harmful to the parts and unavoidable, then it’s hard to see how the whole can run smoothly, with parts of it passing from one state to another, all of them built only to be destroyed in different ways. Does nature set out to cause its own components harm, and make them vulnerable to it—indeed, predestined to it? Or is it oblivious to what goes on? Neither one seems very plausible.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> But suppose we throw out “nature” and explain these things through inherent properties. It would still be absurd to say that the individual things in the world are inherently prone to change, and at the same time be astonished at it or complain—on the grounds that it was happening “contrary to nature.” And least of all when things return to the state from which they came. Because our elements are either simply dispersed, or are subject to a kind of gravitation—the solid portions being pulled toward earth, and what is ethereal drawn into the air, until they’re absorbed into the universal <em class="italic">logo</em><em class="italic">s</em><em class="italic">—</em>which is subject to periodic conflagrations, or renewed through continual change.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And don’t imagine either that those elements—the solid ones and the ethereal—are with us from our birth. Their influx took place yesterday, or the day before—from the food we ate, the air we breathed.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And that’s what changes—not the person your mother gave birth to.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> —But if you’re inextricably linked to it through your sense of individuality?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> That’s not what we’re talking about here.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 8. Epithets for yourself: Upright. Modest. Straightforward. Sane. Cooperative. Disinterested.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Try not to exchange them for others.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And if you should forfeit them, set about getting them back.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Keep in mind that “sanity” means understanding things—each individual thing—for what they are. And not losing the thread.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And “cooperation” means accepting what nature assigns you—accepting it willingly.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And “disinterest” means that the intelligence should rise above the movements of the flesh—the rough and the smooth alike. Should rise above fame, above death, and everything like them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> If you maintain your claim to these epithets—without caring if others apply them to you or not—you’ll become a new person, living a new life. To keep on being the person that you’ve been—to keep being mauled and degraded by the life you’re living—is to be devoid of sense and much too fond of life. Like those animal fighters at the games—torn half to pieces, covered in blood and gore, and still pleading to be held over till tomorrow . . . to be bitten and clawed again.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Set sail, then, with this handful of epithets to guide you. And steer a steady course, if you can. Like an emigrant to the islands of the blest. And if you feel yourself adrift—as if you’ve lost control—then hope for the best, and put in somewhere where you can regain it. Or leave life altogether, not in anger, but matter-of-factly, straightforwardly, without arrogance, in the knowledge that you’ve at least done that much with your life.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And as you try to keep these epithets in mind, it will help you a great deal to keep the gods in mind as well. What they want is not flattery, but for rational things to be like them. For figs to do what figs were meant to do—and dogs, and bees . . . and people.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 9. Operatics, combat and confusion. Sloth and servility. Every day they blot out those sacred principles of yours—which you daydream thoughtlessly about, or just let slide.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Your actions and perceptions need to aim:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • at accomplishing practical ends</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • at the exercise of thought</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> • at maintaining a confidence founded on understanding. An unobtrusive confidence—hidden in plain sight.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_13"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">
<br class="calibre5"/>
</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> When will you let yourself enjoy straightforwardness? Seriousness? Or understanding individual things—their nature and substance, their place in the world, their life span, their composition, who can possess them, whose they are to give and to receive?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 10. Spiders are proud of catching flies, men of catching hares, fish in a net, boars, bears, Sarmatians . . .</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Criminal psychology.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11. How they all change into one another—acquire the ability to see that. Apply it constantly; use it to train yourself. Nothing is as conducive to spiritual growth.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 11a. He has stripped away his body and—realizing that at some point soon he will have to abandon mankind and leave all this behind—has dedicated himself to serving justice in all he does, and nature in all that happens. What people say or think about him, or how they treat him, isn’t something he worries about. Only these two questions: Is what he’s doing now the right thing to be doing? Does he accept and welcome what he’s been assigned? He has stripped away all other occupations, all other tasks. He wants only to travel a straight path—to God, by way of law.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12. Why all this guesswork? You can see what needs to be done. If you can see the road, follow it. Cheerfully, without turning back. If not, hold up and get the best advice you can. If anything gets in the way, forge on ahead, making good use of what you have on hand, sticking to what seems right. (The best goal to achieve, and the one we fall short of when we fail.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 12a. To follow the <em class="italic">logos</em> in all things is to be relaxed and energetic, joyful and serious at once.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 13. When you wake up, ask yourself:</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Does it make any difference to you if other people blame you for doing what’s right?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> It makes no difference.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Have you forgotten what the people who are so vociferous in praise or blame of others are like as they sleep and eat? Forgotten their behavior, their fears, their desires, their thefts and depredations—not physical ones, but those committed by what should be highest in them? What creates, when it chooses, loyalty, humility, truth, order, well-being.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 14. Nature gives and nature takes away. Anyone with sense and humility will tell her, “Give and take as you please,” not out of defiance, but out of obedience and goodwill.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 15. Only a short time left. Live as if you were alone—out in the wilderness. No difference between here and there: the city that you live in is the world.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Let people see someone living naturally, and understand what that means. Let them kill him if they can’t stand it. (Better than living like this.)</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 16. To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 17. Continual awareness of all time and space, of the size and life span of the things around us. A grape seed in infinite space. A half twist of a corkscrew against eternity.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 18. Bear in mind that everything that exists is already fraying at the edges, and in transition, subject to fragmentation and to rot.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Or that everything was born to die.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 19. How they act when they eat and sleep and mate and defecate and all the rest. Then when they order and exult, or rage and thunder from on high. And yet, just consider the things they submitted to a moment ago, and the reasons for it—and the things they’ll submit to again before very long.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 20. Each of us needs what nature gives us, when nature gives it.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 21. “The earth knows longing for the rain, the sky/knows longing . . .” And the world longs to create what will come to be. I tell it “I share your longing.”</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4">

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 23. Keep always before you that “this is no different from an empty field,” and the things in it are the same as on a mountaintop, on the seashore, wherever. Plato gets to the heart of it: “fencing a sheepfold in the mountains, and milking goats or sheep.”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 24. My mind. What is it? What am I making of it? What am I using it for?</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Isolated and torn loose from those around it?</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> To feel grief, anger or fear is to try to escape from something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future. And that ruler is law, which governs what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive—a fugitive from justice.</span></p></div>

And will happen again—the same plot from beginning to end, the identical staging. Produce them in your mind, as you know them from experience or from history: the court of Hadrian, of Antoninus.

And you can do that anywhere. A privilege not granted to a cylinder—to determine its own action. Or to water, or fire, or any of the other things governed by nature alone, or by an irrational soul. Too many things obstruct them and get in their way. But the intellect and <em class="italic">logos</em> are able to make their way through anything in their path—by inborn capacity or sheer force of will. Keep before your eyes the ease with which they do this—the ease with which the <em class="italic">logos</em> is carried through all things, as fire is drawn upward or a stone falls to earth, as a cylinder rolls down an inclined plane.</span></p></div>

All other obstacles either affect the lifeless body, or have no power to shake or harm anything unless misperception takes over or the <em class="italic">logos</em> surrenders voluntarily. Otherwise those they obstruct would be degraded by them immediately. In all other entities, when anything bad happens to them, it affects them for the worse. Whereas here a person is improved by it (if I can put it like that)—and we admire him for reacting as a person should.</span></p></div>

<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 35. A healthy pair of eyes should see everything that can be seen and not say, “No! Too bright!” (which is a symptom of ophthalmia).</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> A healthy sense of hearing or smell should be prepared for any sound or scent; a healthy stomach should have the same reaction to all foods, as a mill to what it grinds.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> So too a healthy mind should be prepared for anything. The one that keeps saying, “Are my children all right?” or “Everyone must approve of me” is like eyes that can only stand pale colors, or teeth that can handle only mush.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 36. It doesn’t matter how good a life you’ve led. There’ll still be people standing around the bed who will welcome the sad event.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Even with the intelligent and good. Won’t there be someone thinking “Finally! To be through with that old schoolteacher. Even though he never said anything, you could always <em class="italic">feel</em> him judging you.” And that’s for a good man. How many traits do <em class="italic">you</em> have that would make a lot of people glad to be rid of you?</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Remember that, when the time comes. You’ll be less reluctant to leave if you can tell yourself, “This is the sort of life I’m leaving. Even the people around me, the ones I spent so much time fighting for, praying over, caring about—even they want me gone, in hopes that it will make their own lives easier. How could anyone stand a longer stay here?”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> And yet, don’t leave angry with them. Be true to who you are: caring, sympathetic, kind. And not as if you were being torn away from life. But the way it is when someone dies peacefully, how the soul is released from the body—that’s how you should leave them. It was nature that bound you to them—that tied the knot. And nature that now unties you.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> I am released from those around me. Not dragged against my will, but unresisting.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> There are things that nature demands. And this is one of them.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 37. Learn to ask of all actions, “Why are they doing that?”</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_9"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> Starting with your own.</span></p></div>
<div class="calibre_5"> </div><div class="calibre_8"><p class="au"><span class="calibre4"> 38. Remember that what pulls the strings is within—hidden from us. Is speech, is life, is the person. Don’t conceive of the rest as part of it—the skin that contains it, and the accompanying organs. Which are tools—like a carpenter’s axe, except that they’re attached to us from birth, and are no more use without what moves and holds them still than the weaver’s shuttle, the writer’s pencil, the driver’s whip.</span></p></div>  <div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_35"></div>
